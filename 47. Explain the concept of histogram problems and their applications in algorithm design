A histogram problem deals with bars of different heights.

You are usually asked to find:

The largest rectangle in the histogram.

Water trapped between bars (rainwater trapping).

Applications:

Area calculations.

Data visualization.

Stock span problems.

Skyline problems.

Algorithm Used: Stack for optimizing rectangle finding to O(n).

Example:
Finding largest rectangle in {2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3} â†’ output = 10.
