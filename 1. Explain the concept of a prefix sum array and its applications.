A prefix sum array is an array where each element at index i is the sum of all elements from the beginning till index i of the original array.

Suppose the array is: [2, 4, 6, 8]

Prefix sum array will be: [2, 6, 12, 20]

2

2+4=6

2+4+6=12

2+4+6+8=20
Applications:

Quickly finding the sum of elements between two indices.

Range queries.

Dynamic programming problems.

Finding subarray sums.

 Algorithm:

Create an array prefix[] of the same size.

Set prefix[0] = arr[0].

For each i from 1 to n-1:
prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i].

 Time Complexity: O(n)
 Space Complexity: O(n)
