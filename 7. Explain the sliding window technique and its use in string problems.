Explanation:
Sliding window is a way to reduce nested loops to a single loop by maintaining a moving subset (window) of elements.

 Use Cases:

Finding maximum/minimum subarrays

Longest substring problems

Fixed-size or variable-size window problems

 Benefits:

Faster algorithms (O(n))

Less memory usage
